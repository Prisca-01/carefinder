#Carefinder

Carefinder is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) hospital search platform bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
It allows users to search for hospitals across Nigerian states, providing detailed information such as contact details, services, and more.

## Getting Started

First, install the project dependencies:

````bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
````

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features

-Search Hospitals: Easily find hospitals by selecting a state and city.
-Detailed Hospital Information: View hospital details including address, phone number, and email.
-User-Friendly Interface: A clean and responsive design ensures a smooth user experience.
-Social Media Authentication: Users can log in using Google, GitHub, or Apple.
